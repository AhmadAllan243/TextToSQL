# TextToSQL

- User-Friendly Data Interaction: The project aims to simplify database access by enabling users to input queries in natural language, eliminating the need for technical SQL knowledge and making data retrieval more accessible.
- Advanced Neural Architecture: It utilizes a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural network enhanced with an attention mechanism, allowing the model to effectively capture context and dependencies within user queries.
- Seq2Seq Based Processing: By integrating Seq2Seq based tokenization and embeddings with a custom encoder-decoder architecture, the system translates natural language into precise SQL statements, ensuring accurate and context-aware outputs.
